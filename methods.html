        <h1>Meteorologists actually use a combination of several different methods to come up 
            with their daily weather forecasts. They are :-</h1>
            <h3><li>Persistence Forecasting</li></h3>
            <h3><li>Synoptic Forecasting</li></h3>

        <h3>Persistence Forecasting</h3><br>
        <p class="text">The simplest method of forecasting the weather is persistence forecasting. It relies 
            upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This can be a valid way of 
            forecasting the weather when it is in a steady state, such as during the summer season in 
            the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant 
            weather pattern. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts. 
            This assumes that what the weather is doing now is what it will continue to do. To find 
            out what the weather is doing, meteorologists make weather observations.</p><hr>
            <h3>Synoptic Forecasting</h3><br>
            <p class="text">  This method uses the basic rules for forecasting. Meteorologists take their 
observations, and apply those rules to make a short-term forecast.</p><hr>
        <h3>Statistical Forecasting</h3><br>
        <p class="text">Meteorologists ask themselves, what does it usually do this time of the 
year? Records of average temperatures, average rainfall and average snowfall over the 
years give forecasters an idea of what the weather is "supposed to be like" at a certain 
time of the year.</p><hr>
<h3>Computer forecasting</h3><br>
<p class="text">Forecasters take their observations and plug the numbers into complicated 
equations. Several ultra-high-speed computers run these various equations to make 
computer "models" which give a forecast for the next several days. Often, different 
equations produce different results, so meteorologists must always use the other 
forecasting methods along with this one. <hr>
